COMP_SCI,308-0,COMP_SCI 308-0 Foundations of Security (1 Unit),"Cybersecurity can be an intimidating word, but it doesn’t need to be. It is actually fundamental to every application or system we use, however small. One does not need to be “interested” in security to be accountable for creating secure programs; anyone who will be responsible for maintaining or building any computer systems will be accountable.  Have you been or do you know anyone who has been a victim of a data breach? Data breaches have become commonplace with the causes often being a simple security mistake/piece of insecure infrastructure with a massive impact. Do you see yourself building a simple application that handles user data? You would have a responsibility to protect your users’ data. Are you interested in cybersecurity as a specialization or career path? You’ll probably get to advise the design of systems to be secure from the ground up and mitigate security incidents in real time. And finally: do you envision yourself in a role where you will either build or manage any systems that people will use? Then your systems need to be secure.  Systems, software, and tools that we use are all vulnerable to security breaches and incidents. However, security, historically and still today, is often an afterthought in the design of computer systems, which only exacerbates their vulnerability. And while cybersecurity itself is a huge and exciting field for those interested, there are core aspects of security that are accessible to and necessary for anyone in a computing-related occupation."

COMP_SCI,312-0,COMP_SCI 312-0 Data Privacy (1 Unit),"Data breaches, privacy breaches, and concerns about algorithmic decision-making have been on the rise. As a result, data privacy has become an increasingly significant concern in the past several years. Individuals and organizations often trust institutions with their data with the expectation that one's data is private from others or to the handling institutions and that it is not used for unfair practices. To ensure the privacy of sensitive data, privacy mechanisms have been developed to preserve the privacy of data without reducing its functionality.  The goal of this course is to introduce you to the concept and implications of data privacy, including mechanisms and protocols that are used to preserve data privacy in practice. We will study concepts such as differential privacy, database anonymization, anonymous communication, and algorithmic fairness.

COMP_SCI,322-0,COMP_SCI 322-0 Compiler Construction (1 Unit),"The compiler is the programmer's primary tool. Understanding the compiler is therefore critical for programmers, even if they never build one. Furthermore, many design techniques that emerged in the context of compilers are useful for a range of other application areas. This course introduces students to the essential elements of building a compiler: parsing, context-sensitive property checking, code linearization, register allocation, etc. To take this course, students are expected to already understand how programming languages behave, to a fairly detailed degree. The material in the course builds on that knowledge via a series of semantics preserving transformations that start with a fairly high-level programming language and culminate in machine code.

COMP_SCI,323-0,COMP_SCI 323-0 Code Analysis and Transformation (1 Unit),"Fast, highly sophisticated code analysis and code transformation tools are essential for modern software development. Before releasing its mobile apps, Facebook submits them to a tool called Infer that finds bugs by static analysis, i.e., without even having to run the code, and guides developers in fixing them. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox analyze and optimize JavaScript code to make browsers acceptably responsive. Performance-critical systems and application software would be impossible to build and evolve without compilers that derive highly optimized machine code from high-level source code that humans can understand. Understanding what modern code analysis and transformation techniques can and can't do is a prerequisite for research on both software engineering and computer architecture since hardware relies on software to realize its potential. In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of code analysis and transformation, and you will apply them by extending LLVM, a compiler framework now in production use by Apple, Adobe, Intel and other industrial and academic enterprises.

And by simple, I mean as simple as high-school algebra. Hence, the course will help you build a foundational understanding of PLs by breaking them down to their most basic ingredients without having to go through PLAI or another meta language. In other words, the course will teach you how to construct mathematical models of PLs. Moreover, because of their mathematical and foundational nature, these models will enable you to describe precisely properties of PLs that in CS 321 we only talked about in an intuitive manner."

This course takes a novel approach to understanding these transformations by partnering a SESP faculty member with industry leaders and change agents to identify and analyze changing organizational forms and the implications for work in the contemporary economy. In doing so, this course will expose students to variants in organizational models, for example, from the highly institutionalized, yet ever changing, digital firm to firm-market hybrids that supply branded service yet do not employ the providers or own the assets that provide services. Students will have weekly analytic assignments that prepare for and reflect on industry co-instructor sessions as well as a final team project. This course is suitable for undergraduate students in LOC, social policy, and related majors throughout northwestern that are interested in leadership or organizational change. This advanced, highly interactive course fulfills new Learning and Organizational Change (LOC) requirements and is open to LOC students and beyond."

You will learn to recognize recurring patterns in your own cognition and that of the people around you, and examine the ways those tendencies can lead people to better or worse courses of action. The class opens with a focus on the work of two research psychologists, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, who developed an important framework for understanding how people reach conclusions and make decisions. Their work formed the foundation of the field of behavioral economics. As we move through the quarter, we will draw on this framework to analyze human judgment and organizational decisionmaking in the domains of medicine, public health, criminal justice, and sports. We will investigate ways to use insights from research to improve the functioning of organizations, with a goal of making life better for the people that work in them and the people they serve. In the final project, working either independently or in a group, you will research an organizational phenomenon and develop a design for change using the theoretical perspectives from the course. Grading is based on quizzes, a midterm, and a final project."

It cannot be emphasized enough how important research, analytic and writing skills are to virtually all careers; nothing is more quickly discrediting of good ideas than bad writing. The first half of class is mainly lecture and discussion. The second half of class has been designed to promote your learning as a writer and thinker in public policy. It will provide students with a designated forum for developing and “work shopping” their written work and discussing issues covered in class. The TA will offer feedback on questions as students write, edit, and revise their papers. We will also frequently practice skills in responding critically to colleagues’ texts.

Supporting productive classroom discourse is a key element in engaging students in meaningful knowledge-building work. Teachers need tools and strategies to create and support an environment in which students feel welcome and responsible for contributing by sharing their ideas, building on one another’s thinking, and working together to further their learning as a community. This course address how to support discourse in the classroom, including designing discussion-based tasks, supporting students in academic discourse, creating a classroom climate supportive of discussion, questioning strategies and talk moves that facilitate discussion, and assessment in discussion-based tasks. We will examine current approaches to supporting effective classroom discussions drawn from elementary, middle school, and high school classrooms, and across multiple disciplines including math, literacy, history, science, and others. Work in the course will involve discussing articles sharing discourse strategies and analyzing video of classroom interactions to see these approaches in action. Students will have the opportunity to work with the tools and strategies of the course in analyzing a classroom discussion they choose to observe, designing discussion-based lessons for their own teaching context, and to try out these tools in facilitating discussions with their peers."
